# Updating WPPluginModernizer

Keeping your WPPluginModernizer plugin up-to-date is crucial for maintaining security, performance, and compatibility with the latest WordPress features. This guide provides an overview of how to update WPPluginModernizer and best practices for preserving your customizations.

## Performing Updates

Updates to WPPluginModernizer can be performed directly through the WordPress plugin dashboard. This ensures that your plugin remains up-to-date with the latest features, bug fixes, and security enhancements.

### How to Update:

1. Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard.
2. Navigate to the **Plugins** section.
3. You'll see a notification under WPPluginModernizer if an update is available. Click the **Update now** link to start the update process.

The update process is automated. Once initiated, WordPress will download and install the latest version of WPPluginModernizer. You'll receive a confirmation once the update is successful.

## Important Note on Customizations

When updating WPPluginModernizer, please be aware that **modifications made directly to the parent plugin's files will be overwritten**. This includes any changes to the plugin's PHP, JavaScript, CSS, or other files that are part of the WPPluginModernizer package.

### Preserving Customizations:

To ensure that your customizations are not lost during an update, **all customizations should be made through child plugins**. Child plugins are separate from the parent WPPluginModernizer plugin and are not affected by updates. This approach allows you to extend or modify the functionality of WPPluginModernizer without risking your changes being overwritten.

#### Creating a Child Plugin:

- If you haven't already, create a child plugin by following the guide in the [Getting Started](/posts/getting-started/) section.
- Implement your customizations within this child plugin, including new services, Gutenberg blocks, API endpoints, and more.

By following this practice, you can safely update WPPluginModernizer whenever a new version is released, ensuring your site benefits from the latest improvements while keeping your customizations intact.
